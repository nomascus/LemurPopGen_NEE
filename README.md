# Lemur Genomics

### This repository contains the code and log files for the lemur comparative genomics project. 

#### Included here are individual readme files for major analysis, including variant calling, heterozygoisty, etc. These files refer to particular cripts that I have written, which are located in the SCRIPTS folder

#### Relevant metadata files are listed in the METADATA folder

#### This is incomplete, of course, and will continue to be updated and improved. What I have here isn't the public facing version that I will post later, so there are lot of messy draft versions of scripts in the SCRIPTS folder and some work-in-progress type text in some of the readmes
